Hi Bill,

Thanks again for all the great help this summer and for sharing that awesome cheese! Congratulations on your coming graduation and for choosing to help us and the College improve our security ecosystem as your final project. My thoughts are listed below.

The spreadsheets with the results are very difficult to read and are mostly ignored. We once had access to the tool and the links from the results were simple to use.
Resolving the IP addresses from the Nessus results to host names and linking to their Defender Security Center enrollment page would be really handy. Not sure how you would link/normalize the discovered issues from both tools.
If I recall correctly, which less likely after every day, there were remediation steps and related info for the discovered issues included in the Nessus results(in the tool). Providing this would be helpful.
A dynamic dashboard that has vulnerabilities and resolution options from both Nessus and security center that would provide info on remediation. A way to browse to each system from there.
A button I could click to solve all the issues.

Iâ€™ll send antyhing else that comes to mind. Thanks for all your hard work!
