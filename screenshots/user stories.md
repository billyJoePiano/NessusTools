### Security Team Members

Jesse is a member of the Security Team.  He has used Nessus frequently to get information about security vulnerabilities on the College's network and computing systems.  However, in its current format this data can be difficult to use and search.  He'd like some improved ways to utilize it.

Zach is another member of the Security Team.  He administers the Splunk server, which is the central security data logging service for all of his organization's infrastructure.  Zach wants to make sure the Nessus data is included in Splunk's data set, so it can be searched and cross referenced with the other data available there.


### Desktop Engineering and Help Desk Members

Members of the Help Desk recieve frequent calls from their organization's staff and/or customer who are using laptop, desktops, and other technology devices associated with the organization.  Sometimes they have to help fix systems that were compromised when a user accidentally downloaded malware after clicking on a phishing link.  They would like the ability to conduct external scans on these devices, to gain additional information about possible vulnerabilities, but right now they don't have any way to do this.


### Server Team

Colleen is the lead of the server and storage team.  There are many critical systems her team has to administer which the entire college network depends upon.  She would like to know what recent Nessus scans were done and which ones are scheduled, so her team can plan and so the scans don't trigger a panic when the servers think they are under attack.  She would also like to know the results of these scans, and the ability to start them as needed, so the server team can find any gaps in their upgrades.
