# The below configurations should be adjusted based on the scanner being queried.
# Each scanner should have a unique hostname & API keys (obviously...)
# as well as a unique DB name, and output directory.
#
# Typically, the hostname, db name, and output directory will be the same,
# although this isn't a requirement.  However, it is critically important
# that the output directory and db name be unique for each Nessus scanner being queried,
# or else they will be overwriting each other's data and possibly causing exceptions at
# NessusTools runtime

# Nessus API connection.  Port is optional.  Protocol is required

# JDBC driver class, required
db.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Required.  db.dialect is for Hibernate
# You may need to change this if not using mySQL.
# For more info, refer to Hibernate's documentation on dialect configuration.
# Typically this property would be statically configured in hibernate.cfg.xml,
# but NessusTools dynamically configures it at runtime when first creating the
# SessionFactoryBuilder, using the value provided here
db.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
