Enterprise Java Project ideas

- Mobile dashboard for Splunk https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splunk-mobile/id1420299852 -- cool but may not involve much Java???
-** Nessus dashboard -- integrate with Splunk??? ** YES
- XX PWM (Identity service?) ??? XX  Probably not do-able???


Nessus App

User Stories
Interview with IT-Security Team (Cory, Zach Ward, Jesse La Grew)
-Interface between Splunk and Nessus is broken, stopped working
-No one outside of the Security Team can read reports
-Single user for login to Nessus ... need to have a way for users to login individually with custom dashboards
-Individuals want to be able to scan themselves, but can't initiate that scan
-Want Data in Splunk to correlate with other findings/data, and give data access to other individuals with Splunk access
-Need Nessus vulnerability information to be accessible & searchable
-Need to start baselining asset inventory from network scans, and comparing to known assets
-Want to see new vulnerabilities and devices that appear

Jesse La Grew also sent this list of problems / pain points:
-Unable to see scans for my devices
-Unable to update the list of devices that I own
-Scan reports are too detailed and not easy to consume/read
-Do not see any changes in scan results over time
-Data is not available within Splunk
-Sign-ins required for individuals to see reports - would like people to see reports without logging into Nessus
